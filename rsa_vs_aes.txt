RSA is an asymmetric (public key) algorithm.
It uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
AES is a symmetric algorithm.
It uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption.

RSA is mathematically heavy and much slower than AES.
It is not effective for encrypting large files or data streams.
AES is very fast and efficient,
It is suitable for encrypting large amounts of data (files, disks, network traffic).

RSA typically uses large key sizes to provide security.
AES uses shorter keys.

RSA is mainly used for: Key exchange (e.g., to securely send symmetric keys in TLS/HTTPS)
Digital signatures and certificate-based authentication.
-AES is mainly used for:
Encryption of files, backups and databases
Full disk encryption and more.

Combined (hybrid) use
In real systems, RSA and AES are often combined:
RSA protects the AES key, while AES encrypts the actual data.
This provides the strong security of public key cryptography with the high performance of symmetric encryption.
