1. Type of Algorithm
- RSA is an asymmetric (public-key) algorithm.
  It uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
- AES is a symmetric algorithm.
  It uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption.

2. Performance
- RSA is mathematically heavy and much slower than AES.
  It is not efficient for encrypting large files or data streams.
- AES is very fast and efficient, especially with hardware acceleration (AES-NI).
  It is suitable for encrypting large amounts of data (files, disks, network traffic).

3. Key Sizes and Security
- RSA usually uses large key sizes (2048 or 4096 bits) to provide security.
  Even with large key sizes, it is mainly used for small pieces of data (keys, hashes).
- AES uses shorter keys (128, 192, or 256 bits),
  but for symmetric ciphers this already provides very strong security.

4. Typical Use Cases
- RSA is mainly used for:
  * Key exchange (e.g., in TLS/HTTPS to send a symmetric key securely)
  * Digital signatures and certificate-based authentication
  * Encrypting small secrets such as session keys
- AES is mainly used for:
  * Encrypting files, backups, and databases
  * Full-disk encryption
  * VPNs, TLS data encryption, and other high-throughput scenarios

5. Combined (Hybrid) Use
- In real systems RSA and AES are often combined:
  RSA protects the AES key, and AES encrypts the actual data.
  This gives the strong security of public-key cryptography
  together with the high performance of symmetric encryption.
